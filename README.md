# Nike Supply Chain Cost Analysis

This project explores how global shipping, oil, and congestion factors impact **Nike’s supply chain costs and regional performance**.  
Using **Python** for data generation, cleaning, and correlation modeling, and **Tableau** for visualization, the analysis uncovers key relationships between logistics expenses, fuel prices, and Nike’s revenue trends.

---

## Project Overview

As a data analyst, my goal was to evaluate how external global shipping conditions influence Nike’s operating costs and profitability.  
The project simulates real-world freight, oil, and congestion data, integrates it with Nike’s regional revenue estimates, and visualizes key insights through an interactive Tableau dashboard.

The analysis focuses on understanding how fluctuations in logistics inputs — such as freight costs, oil prices, and port congestion — affect Nike’s financial and operational performance.

## Core Questions Answered

- How do global freight and oil prices correlate with Nike’s supply chain costs?  
- Which regions experience the highest average freight costs?  
- How do shipping expenses trend alongside Nike’s revenue?  
- What insights can be drawn from the correlation between transportation and financial variables?  

---

## Key Insights

### 1. Supply Chain Correlations
- Strong positive correlation between **freight cost index** and **oil prices**, reflecting the dependency of transport cost on fuel markets.  
- **Shipping costs** move closely with overall **supply chain expenses**, particularly in high-demand periods.  

### 2. Regional Analysis
- Regions with higher congestion indices (e.g., Asia-Pacific) tend to show elevated average freight costs.  
- Stable performance in North America, despite global volatility, suggests robust supply chain efficiency.  

### 3. Revenue vs Shipping Cost
- Nike’s revenue growth shows partial sensitivity to global shipping costs — indicating effective cost management but potential risk exposure in extreme price conditions.
